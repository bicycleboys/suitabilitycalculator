        Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) is a measure of how stressful a particular segment of road is to bicycle on.
        It includes factors such as the type of bike facility and the speed on the street if cyclists and motor vehicles share the space.

        The levels roughly correspond to the <a href="http://www1.coe.neu.edu/~pfurth/Other%20papers/Dill%202013%204%20types%20of%20cyclists%20TRR.pdf">types of cyclists described by Dill and McNeil</a>:
        <ol>
            <li>Strong separation of cyclists from motor vehicles, suitable for children</li>
            <li>Physical separation from high-speed or multilane traffic, for the "interested but concerned" cyclist</li>
            <li>Involves interaction with moderate speed or multilane traffic, for the "enthused and confident" cyclists</li>
            <li>Involves interaction with high-speed traffic, for the "strong and fearless" cyclists</li>
        </ol>

        The grades we assign to each level are not a part of the original LTS calculations, but we use them to quickly convey what the ideal value is.
