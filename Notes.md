# Information Requirements for Different Calculators
- [LTS](http://www.northeastern.edu/peter.furth/research/level-of-traffic-stress/):
  - Segment type (Stand-alone, segregated, bike lane, mixed traffic)
  - right turn lane/bike lane interfacing at intersection approach
  - (if bike lane) number of lanes per direction
  - (if bike lane) sum of bike lane and parking lane width
     - or just bike lane width if not adjacent
     - if there's a separating median
  - (if bike lane/mixed traffic) speed limit (or prevailing speed if speed limit isn't followed)
  - (if bike lane) blockage frequency
  - (if mixed traffic) number of lanes _not sure if this is different from number of lanes per direction_
  - (if mixed traffic) marked center lines
  - (if mixed traffic) average daily traffic
  - _some stuff about unsignalized crossings that I don't fully understand, uses lanes and speed limit_
  - "If speed limit < 25 mph, or land use is residential with little parking turnover, then any width is acceptable for LTS 2" in table 2 is hard to encode into formal logic

- [BLOS]
  - parking occupancy, as a percentage
  - midsegment demand flow rate, in vehicles per hour
  - width of outside through lane, in feet
  - width of bike lane, in feet
  - width of paved outside shoulder, in feet
  - presence of curbs, as a binary flag (0 = no curbs, 1 = curbs present)
  - heavy vehicles in the midsection flow rate, as a percentage
  - motorized vehicle running speed, in miles per hour
  - lanes in the subject direction of travel, as a number
  - pavement condition rating, as a number between 0.0 and 5.0

- [PLOS]
  - width of outside through lane, in feet
  - width of bike lane, in feet
  - width of paved outside shoulder, in feet
  - presence of curbs, as a binary flag (0 = no curbs, 1 = curbs present)
  - parking occupancy, as a percentage
  - buffer width between roadway and sidewalk, in feet
  - presence of a continuous barrier at least 3 feet high, as 5.37 if there exists such a barrier and 1 if not
  - adjusted available sidewalk width, in feet, with a maximum value of 10
  - midblock demand flow rate, in vehicles per hour
  - through lanes on the street in the direction of travel being considered, as number of lanes
  - vehicle running speed, in miles per hour
